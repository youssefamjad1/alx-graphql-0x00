# Character Queries

This folder contains GraphQL queries to fetch character details by ID (1, 2, 3, 4) from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API.

Each `.graphql` file contains a query to fetch the fields: id, name, status, species, type, gender.

The corresponding `-output.json` files contain the responses from the API.
